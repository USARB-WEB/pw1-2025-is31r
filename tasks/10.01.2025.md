## Task 1

Create an array that contains at least 10 numbers (the algorithm should work for any number of elements)

[1, 5, 0, -5, 30, 100, -500, 0, 100, 55]

Write the following functions to process this array:

- outputs numbers < 5
- finds the positions of elements with the maximum and minimum values
- sorts the array in descending order
- outputs the elements of the array that have a value greater than the arithmetic mean of all elements of the array

## Task 2

Given an array [8, 7, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 9, 0, 1]
Write a function uniqueSorted that will remove duplicates from the array and return an array of unique values ​​sorted in ascending order
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

## Task 3
Write code, completing the task from each point on a separate line:
